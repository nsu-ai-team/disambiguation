This folder contains an approach to sense disambiguation task based on the following work: 
@article{kiros2015skip,
  title={Skip-Thought Vectors},
  author={Kiros, Ryan and Zhu, Yukun and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan and Zemel, Richard S and Torralba, Antonio and Urtasun, Raquel and Fidler, Sanja},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.06726},

}

Files in this folder, except for main.py and test.py, are based on this repository: https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts, 
however we made some changes, such as adopting the code to Python 3.

Run main.py to use this code. You may use command line arguments to specify how the program should work. 
Run main.py -h or main.py --help to learn how to use them.

This program was developed by Vadim Fomin as a part of a group working on Dialogue Evaluation 2018 at the Novosibirsk University.
